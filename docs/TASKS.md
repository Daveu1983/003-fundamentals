# Coding Tasks

**Note**

Where applicable, try to do the coding tasks with [ping pong pair programming](http://wiki.c2.com/?PairProgrammingPingPongPattern). 

For example, in your pairs, person A could do task 2, observe that the test fails because task 3 has not been completed. 

Person B then implements the code for task 3. 

You then re-run the test and find that it passes.

Then Person B writes the test and code for task 4.

Person A writes the code and implements the function for task 5 and so on and so on.

## 1) What use is an empty library?

The library currently doesn't have any books! We've had word that 3 new books have arrived.

Each book has the following properties/attributes associated with it:

* Title (String)
* Author (String)
* Available (Boolean)

The three books we've had delivered are:

* Don't Make Me Think by Steve Krug
* Site Reliability Engineering by Niall Richard Murphy
* Fantastic Mr Fox by Roald Dahl

You can assume that each book has not yet been borrowed by anyone.

Using the information above make sure the library is now populated with the new book deliveries.
