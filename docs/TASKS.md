# Coding Tasks

**Note**

Where applicable, try to do the coding tasks with [ping pong pair programming](http://wiki.c2.com/?PairProgrammingPingPongPattern). 

For example, in your pairs, person A could do task 2, observe that the test fails because task 3 has not been completed. 

Person B then implements the code for task 3. 

You then re-run the test and find that it passes.

Then Person B writes the test and code for task 4.

Person A writes the code and implements the function for task 5 and so on and so on.
