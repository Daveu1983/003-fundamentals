# Week 1 - Programming Fundamentals

# Objects and Arrays

## Introduction

Can you remember the [package.json](https://github.com/techreturners/001-fundamentals/blob/master/package.json) from your first coding exercises?

Within the [instructions we discussed](https://github.com/techreturners/001-fundamentals/blob/master/docs/RUNNING-APPLICATION.md#packagejson) that the package.json was in fact an object. 

During the next exercises we'll explore Javascript objects further.


## Technology

We'll continue to make use of the Javascript programming language within a [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) environment and utilising a test framework called [Jest]( https://jestjs.io/en/) to run our code.

## Instructions

All the running and execution instructions are exactly the same as the previous fundamentals coding tasks. 

We'll now be working with some new code. The [library.js](./app/library.js) provides functionality for a working public library. It allows us to see which books are part of the library's collection and allows us to see which books are available (IE Not currently checked out).

**NOTE** Don't forget you will still need to `npm install` because we're in a new application code base.

Head on over to [tasks to get started](./docs/TASKS.md).
