# Week 1 - Programming Fundamentals

# Objects and Arrays

## Introduction

## Technology

We'll continue to make use of the Javascript programming language within a [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) environment and utilising a test framework called [Jest]( https://jestjs.io/en/) to run our code.

## Instructions

All the running and execution instructions are exactly the same as the previous fundamentals coding tasks. 

**NOTE** Don't forget you will still need to `npm install` because we're in a new application code base.

Head on over to [tasks to get started](./docs/TASKS.md).
